                      WHILE AI “ETHICS” IS THE TOPIC DU JOUR FOR THE TECH
                      INDUSTRY, HUMAN RIGHTS IS BEGINNING TO EMERGE AS AN

                Technology companies should find effective channels of communication with local civil society groups and researchers – particularly in geographic areas where human rights concerns are high – in order to identify and respond to risks related to AI deployments.

                      WHILE SOME MAJOR INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS
                      ORGANIZATIONS ARE STARTING TO FOCUS ON AI,
                      ADDITIONAL ATTENTION IS NEEDED FROM CIVIL SOCIETY ON
                      POTENTIAL RISKS AND HARMS.

                  Technology companies and researchers should conduct HRIAs throughout the lifecycle of their AI systems. Researchers should reevaluate HRIA methodology for AI,particularly in light of new developments in algorithmic impact assessments. Toolkits should be developed to assess specific industry needs.

                      DOZENS OF COUNTRIES HAVE INITIATED NATIONAL
                      STRATEGIES ON AI, YET HUMAN RIGHTS ARE NOT CENTRAL TO
                      MANY OF THESE EFFORTS.

                    Governments should acknowledge their human rights obligations and incorporateduty to protect fundamental rights in national AI policies, guidelines, and possible regulations. Governments can play a more active role in multilateral institutions, like the UN,to advocate for AI development that respects human rights.

                <div>
                      UN human rights investigators and special rapporteurs should continue researching
                      and publicizing the human rights impacts resulting from AI systems. UN officials and

                      participating governments should evaluate whether existing UN mechanisms for inter-
                      national rights monitoring, accountability, and redress are adequate to respond to AI

                      and other rapidly emerging technologies. UN leadership should also assume a central
                      role in international technology debates by promoting shared global values based on
                      fundamental rights and human dignity.

                      MORE WORK CAN BE DONE TO BRIDGE ACADEMICS IN
                      HUMAN RIGHTS LAW, SOCIAL SCIENCE, COMPUTER SCIENCE,
                      PHILOSOPHY, AND OTHER DISCIPLINES IN ORDER TO
                      CONNECT RESEARCH ON THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF AI, NORMS

                    Academics should further examine the value, limitations, and interactions between hu-
                    man rights law and human dignity approaches; humanitarian law; and ethics in relation
                    to emerging AI technologies. Human rights and legal scholars should work with other
                    stakeholders on the tradeoffs between rights when faced with specific AI risks and
                    harms. Social science researchers should empirically investigate the on-the-ground
                    impact of AI on human rights.
