# Governing Artificial Intelligence
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Brief description of the report
  Our GAI app showcases how Mark Latonero leverages human rights as a “North Star” to guide the development and governance of artificial intelligence.”

## What is the purpose of the website
  The purpose of our website is to bring awareness of human rights in AI issues.
 
 
## Who is your audience
  The intended audience include  technology companies, governments, intergovernmental organizations, civil society groups, academia, and the United Nations (UN) system.  In general, the audience are stakeholders looking to incorporate human rights into social and organizational contexts related to the development and governance of AI.

## What features make your website unique 
   Our team of software engineers combine ideas from a very diverse international tech and cultural background to design a very unique website.  Not only do our React engineering team built a solid foundation with responsive design and routers, our creative graphic director/designer also upgrades from the basic CSS requirement to include SASS.  She incorporates grid, flex, reusable components and @mixin seamlessly to make a visually impressive graphic art for the website.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
